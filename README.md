# üöÄ ECS EC2 Launch Type CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform (Console Pipeline Repo - ECS Infra only)

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to provision an end-to-end AWS ECS cluster (EC2 launch type) with an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and a complete CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild to deploy a Dockerized application from source to ECS.

## üì¶ Features

- üõ° **VPC** with public subnets
- üåê Internet Gateway and route tables
- üîí Security group for HTTP and SSH access
- üß© **ECS cluster** using EC2 launch type
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Auto Scaling Group** with Launch Template for ECS instances
- üéØ **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** forwarding traffic to ECS tasks
- üê≥ ECS Service with Task Definition for Nginx demo container
- üîë IAM roles and policies for ECS instances
- üõ† **CI/CD pipeline** using AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild:
  - üì• Pulls source from GitHub
  - üèó Builds and pushes Docker image to Amazon ECR
  - üöÄ Updates ECS Service with the new Task Definition

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Terraform installed
- AWS CLI configured
- AWS account with permissions to create:
  - VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, Route Tables
  - EC2 instances, Security Groups
  - IAM Roles
  - ECS Cluster & Service
  - Application Load Balancer
  - CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and ECR repository

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** You must create the AWS CodeStar (or CodeConnections) connection to GitHub manually in the AWS Console before deploying. This is not provisioned by Terraform.

## üìù Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This repository sets up the infrastructure. You can add the actual CodePipeline and CodeBuild resources by configuring them manually in the AWS Console.
- Make sure to replace:
  - IAM ARNs
  - AMI IDs
  - Region-specific values
  with valid ones for your AWS account and region.
